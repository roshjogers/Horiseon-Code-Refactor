# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Refactoring code on Horiseon's Website

I was asked by a marketing agency to make the codebase for their website follow accessibility standards. Doing so helped optimization for search engines. Using the existing code, I worked to add accessibility features and clean up the code, adding comments in the HTML and CSS file and fixing a broken link in the header.
