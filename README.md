# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

##Refactoring code on Horiseon's Website

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I was asked by a marketing agency to make the codebase for their website follow accessibility standards. Doing so helped optimization for search engines. Using the existing code, I worked to add accessibility features and clean up the code, adding comments in the HTML and CSS file
